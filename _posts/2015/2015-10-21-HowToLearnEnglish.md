	The absolute best way to learn any new language is just to speak it.It doesn't matter if you only know five english words or you're pratically fluent -- speaking english with another persion is the fasting.most effective method of improving.

	* Find a native english speaker who is willing to spend some time speaking english with you.you may be able to offer them a language exchange,where they spend 30 minutes speaking english with you and you spend 30 minutes speaking your native language with them.

	* Be aware that the pronunciation of certain english words varies greatly depending on the part of world it's spoken in.For example,American english is very different from british english.If you intent to travel to or live in an english-speaking country.This is something you should take into account when learning to pronounce ceitain words.
3. Expand your vocabulary and use idiomatic phrases.The wider your vocabulary and the more english phrases you learn,the easier speaking English will become.

	* Once you have learned a new word or phrase,you shold make an effort to use it in a sentence.this is the best way to commit it to memory.
	* Another waty to cimmit new words to memory is to make label for everyday household items and stick them arround your house and apartment.then every time you use kettle or look in the mirror,you will see the english word for these items staring back at you.
	* you shold alse start a notebook of idomatic phrases that english speakers use all the time.some examples include "it's raining cats and dogs",to be on "cloid nine" or saying something is a "piece of cake".Spring these kind of phrases into your conversation will bring your level of english up several notches.
4. Attend an English class or discussion group.Another great way to incorporate some extra english conversation into your weekly routine is to sign up for a class of discussion group.
	* Attending an english class is a great way to focus on some of the more formal aspects of speaking english.A class will teach you the grammatically correct way of speaking,whick includes proper sentence structure and verb conjugation and will generally provide a very structured approach to language learning.
	* Attending a discussion group is a more informal and relaxed way of learning english.where the emphasis is more on communication and relationship building than on speaking "correct" English.Speaking in this setting can help you to become more comfortable with speaking in front of other people.
	* Both of these language-learning settings have their pros and cons,so it's best to do both of you can.
5. Carry a dictionary.Carrying an english dictionary with you at all times can be very useful.
	* Having a dictionary means you will never be stuck for a word.It can save you a lot of embarrassment if you are having a conversation with an english speaker and forget a word in the middle of the sentence.all you have to do is take a second to look it up!
	* Aside from save your awkwardness, looking up the word you need then immediately using it in a sentence will actually help you to commit the new vocabulary to memory
	* it is also helpful to have a dictionay to preuse throughout the day during private moments.like when you are sitting on the train,waiting to cross the street or just having a cup of coffee.you could learn an extra 20-30 english words pre day using this technique!
	* As a beginner.you should start with an english dictionary that provides definitions in your native language.However,once your language skills improve,you should switch to using a english-english dictionary,which provides english definitions for english words.
